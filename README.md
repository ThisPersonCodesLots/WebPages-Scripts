# WebPages Scripts

This repository contains a list of JavaScript file that I use to customize webpages. They are personal scripts that I use to make my browsing experience more enjoyable. I am sharing them here in case they are useful to anyone else.

## How it works

The repository contains undefined number of files that are meant to be used with the Tampermonkey extension for Chrome. Each file is a script that can be run on a webpage to customize it. 

## Usage

Use git to clone the repository to your local machine. Then, use the Tampermonkey extension to add the scripts (one by one) to your browser.
